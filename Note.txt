"summary":"HONEY, PYM SHRUNK THE KIDS

FROM THE WRITERS OF TV'S THE GOLDBERGS! After he nearly caused a Skrull attack in our last issue, the management at Damage Control has wisely chosen to try and place Gus in a less volatile position. How much harm can Gus do in the Consumer Affairs office, listening to complaints and grievances? Actually, the answer is a lot. When things get out of control, Gus has to call on Ant-Man and the Wasp to try and turn a big problem into a little one in a story we call 'Honey, Pym Shrunk the Kids'! Adam F. Goldberg and Hans Rodionoff tap the keys while the incomparable Will Robson turns words into glorious art as Gus makes a horrible first impression on the Punisher, Ant-Man, the Wasp and more! ",

After two disastrous days of office mayhem, Head Intern Bart Rozum decides that he has to find Gus a job outside of the Flatiron Building—so he assigns Gus to the Search and Rescue unit. Bart thinks, if Gus is mostly responding to the scenes of superhuman battles after the fact, how much trouble could he really get in to? Unfortunately, on Gus’ first day with Search and Rescue, the unit is summoned to New Jersey to deal with a giant mutated catfish monster who calls himself Trentonn the Terrible. ADAM F. GOLDBERG and HANS RODIONOFF write pithy dialogue while NATHAN STOCKMAN adds his visual wizardry to bring you a tale of Catfish Kaiju, Insurance Fraud and Terrigenesis with special appearances from the Black Tarantula, Hammerhead and the God of Thunder himself…the Mighty Thor!

It’s been a tough first week for Gus at Damage Control. On Monday, he nearly caused a catastrophic Skrull attack.

That’s why Gus has been banished down to research and development to assist Eugene Strausser.

Seems like it should be fairly low-risk. However, this is Gus we’re talking about, and before the day is over, there will be a massive morass of mechanical mayhem perpetrated by Machine Man, Jocasta, Sentry 459, TESS-ONE and Sentinels galore!

"summary":"GRADUATION DAY, CHAPTER ONE

Jaime Reyes has a lot to juggle. Whether it's his finals for senior year or a new villain tearing up El Paso, Jaime is always torn between two worlds. But when his worlds come crashing together at his high school graduation, nothing will ever be the same. A message from the Reach bombards Jaime's scarab, Khaji Da, and it starts throwing off his connection to the device. And as if that wasn't enough, Jaime's parents and friends are pressuring him about his next steps in life. But what's hidden here on Earth that's drawing the Reach back? And where did this new Fadeaway Man come from? Can Jaime find balance in his life and rise to become a true hero, or is it curtains for Blue Beetle?",
