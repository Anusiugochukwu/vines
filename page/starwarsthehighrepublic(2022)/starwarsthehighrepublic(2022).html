A NEW CHAPTER BEGINS FOR STAR WARS: THE HIGH REPUBLIC! One hundred and fifty years before the fall of Starlight, another beacon burns bright in the galaxy, a beacon of faith and spirituality. Jedha.

Jedi Vildar Mac, a Jedi safe and secure in who he is and what he could be, arrives as Jedha’s fragile peace begins to crumble. But a nightmare awaits…a nameless terror that will become the stuff of legend.",
