"summary":"At the end of World War II, Earth was invaded by giant mechanized Parademons from a planet called APOKOLIPS. The planet’s protectors, the Justice Society of America, were devastated and with them, the age of Super Heroes came to an end, and the era of the Mech began.

In the ensuing years, the world has stockpiled colossal battle suits piloted by elite warriors, waiting for the day Apokolips returns. But when Kal-El, the last son of a dying world, crash lands in Metropolis with his own warsuit, he’ll face down two of earth’s greatest Mech fighters, The Flash and Batman.

The dawn of a brave new mechanized DCU is here from the rising star creative team of Kenny Porter (Flash: The Fastest Man Alive, Fearless) and Baldemar Rivas (Robins, Batman: Urban Legends).",
