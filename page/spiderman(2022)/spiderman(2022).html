“The End of the Spider-Verse” is here! Morlun is back and he is not alone. Allied with one of the most powerful beings known to the Spider-Verse, the scariest Spider-Villain of all time is making his biggest play and no Spider is safe. Especially not the Chosen Spider himself, Peter Parker. With Peter working for Norman Osborn and using a glider…does he have it coming? Spidey’s 60th Anniversary is no joke as two of the most legendary Spider-Creators are working together on Spidey for the first time and you know it’s going to be one for the record books! ",
