TRIAL BY MAGIC AND FIRE! Carol's 'crimes' against a powerful foe are coming back to haunt her as Agatha Harkness, helming a tribunal of some of Marvel's most powerful magic-wielders, puts her on trial. But Captain Marvel isn't exactly thrilled to recognize this court's authority, nor does she appreciate being held against her will. Back on Earth, in the midst of a spiraling identity crisis, Binary's skills are put to the test when she must aid Spider-Woman in protecting humans against themselves.",

HELL HATH NO FURY LIKE A WITCH SCORNED! While Captain Marvel has managed to break free from her magical prison, she hasn’t broken free of Enchantress’s rage and thus finds an even worse problem waiting for her in New York. It’s a problem all too familiar, but with a deadly secret at its heart—one that could destroy Carol if she makes the wrong move. And what about Lauri-Ell vs. Binary? We haven’t forgotten about that!",
