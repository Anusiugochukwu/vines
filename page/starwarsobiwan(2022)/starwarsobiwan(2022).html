THE BATTLE OF ABRION BRIDGE! While continuing to wait out a nasty sandstorm on Tatooine, Obi-Wan reflects on one of his most grueling experiences in the Clone Wars… It’s a memory full of pain and bloodshed, and one that has lasting consequences. The battle also reminds Obi-Wan of an age-old question he has long wrestled with throughout his life: what is a Jedi’s true purpose in war?",

As the sandstorm overtakes his home, Obi-Wan has more time to reflect in — and on — the darkness. He looks back on a time when he and Anakin Skywalker were pulled off the front lines of the Clone Wars to confront a lost soul from Kenobi’s wartime past. Can the two Jedi bring a man back from the heart of darkness to which he has fallen?",

Obi-Wan has closed his journals for now and looks ahead as night falls and the sandstorm that has sequestered him begins to clear. But he discovers something unexpected in the hazards of the Jundland Wastes…a squad of ambushed stormtroopers left to die. But one still has a fighting chance…and Obi-Wan may very well risk everything to save a single injured imperial stormtrooper that can’t help but remind Kenobi of the clones he served with so long ago.",
