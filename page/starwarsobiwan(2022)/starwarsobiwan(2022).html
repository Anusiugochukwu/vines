THE BATTLE OF ABRION BRIDGE! While continuing to wait out a nasty sandstorm on Tatooine, Obi-Wan reflects on one of his most grueling experiences in the Clone Wars… It’s a memory full of pain and bloodshed, and one that has lasting consequences.

He looks back on a time when he and Anakin Skywalker were pulled off the front lines of the Clone Wars to confront a lost soul from Kenobi’s wartime past.
