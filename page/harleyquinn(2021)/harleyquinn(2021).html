Skintight suit, mucho muscles, and that hair! Anyways, Batwoman’s in this one, and we might finally reveal Verdict’s true identity! Will the mystery be solved in time to save my good name?

It’s the moment we’ve been building toward for months! The rumble in the jungle! But actually in Gotham, because we’re not in the jungle. It’s the throwdown showdown between me, your hyper-verbal, semi-reformed former villain, and Verdict, the violent vigilante vowing to have vengeance on…well, everybody! Can I clear my name after being locked up for a crime I didn’t commit?",

One small step for the Gotham villains, one giant leap for clown-kind! That’s right…this fashionably vocal clown is headed to space.

Anyway, this alien-monster-thing might not get a chance to devour Task Force XX, because we’re probably gonna kill each other first.

Not all of us are going to survive, but at least we’ll look really good dying thanks to Luke Fox providin’ some new gear.
