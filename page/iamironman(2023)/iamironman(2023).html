"summary":"CHAPTER ONE: HERO

Beneath the red and gold armor is a hopeless romantic, a genius inventor, a war hero, a billionaire, an Avenger, a person, TONY STARK. Dynamic Duo Murewa Ayodele and Dotun Akande (MOON KNIGHT: BLACK, WHITE & BLOOD, IRON MAN #25 and AVENGERS UNLIMITED) unite again to journey through the rich history of IRON MAN—telling stories never seen before that are set in iconic eras of ol’ Shellhead. No better way to celebrate Iron Man’s 60TH ANNIVERSARY than getting to watch him be the Earth’s mightiest hero who we love so much. Kaiju battles under the sea, alien invasions in the desert, a rescue mission in outer space, all that and more are to be expected in this new series—ideal for readers new to Iron Man and longstanding fans of the Golden Avenger.",
