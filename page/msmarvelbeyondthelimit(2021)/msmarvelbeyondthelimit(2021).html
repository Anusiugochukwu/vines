"summary":"Elephants and illusions and doppelgangers, oh my! Ms. Marvel punches her way out of the Bollywood bubble she landed in when she got home from Chicago. But things are not exactly normal, and she still has no idea what happened—or if it could happen again. What’s worse, it seems like she has a copycat lurking around Jersey City, and whoever they are, they’re ruining her good name. They’re escalating from snack thievery to scuffles with civilians, and wonky powers or no, Ms. Marvel has to find them. Fast.",

"summary":"Ms. Marvel has a doppelganger—which is pretty weird. It turns out she’s a teenage girl named Qarin, and she has shapeshifting powers too. She’s lost—like, from-another-universe lost—so, of course, Ms. Marvel takes her under her wing, which isn’t so bad. What’s less good is that Qarin has already figured out Kamala’s secret identity, and she might just have darker plans in mind than trying to find her way home. Will Ms. Marvel’s glitchy powers be enough to stop her?",
