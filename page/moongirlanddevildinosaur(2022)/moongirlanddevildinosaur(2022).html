"summary":"Being a preteen super hero is hard. Doing it when your parents finally know about it is even harder. Good thing Lunella Lafayette (A.K.A. Moon Girl, Inhuman super-genius) has a plan to keep heroing. To provide herself with the perfect alibi, she organizes a roller derby team of other Inhuman kids. It’s just supposed to be an excuse to get out of the apartment with all her super-hero gear in tow, but it turns out to be kind of…fun?
