"summary":"EXTINCTION AGENDA — PART 3

Panic in Shi’ar space! The Marauders are prisoners of the Kin Crimson, a secret society stretching back billions of years, who outrank even the Shi’ar Majestrix…or so they think. But Captain Pryde and the Marauders aren’t giving up, not with the Shi’ar holding the last survivors of mutantkind’s first generation hostage. With the weight of history looming like a nuclear threat, can Kate Pryde convince Xandra to side with mutantkind against her kingdom?",

THE FIRST GENERATION OF MUTANTKIND? The Marauders have gotten some jailbreak mixed into their heist! Pryde and her crew might’ve convinced Xandra to confront the Shi’ar’s crimes against mutantkind together, but the fanatical Kin Crimson are ready to defend those secrets to the death. What hidden truths and horrors does the Shi’ar Chronicle hold? Deep in a pandimensional prison lies the answer—but will it unite two societies in progress, or destroy them both? ",
