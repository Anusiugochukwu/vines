"summary":"PETER DAVID RETURNS TO JOE FIXIT! Peter David’s tour de force through some of his greatest Hulk hits continues with a return to JOE FIXIT! Gone are the ripped-up shorts of the Hulk of yore—this enforcer prefers the slick suave of a striped suit, and the Hulk has traded in “monster” for “mobster” as he lends his strength to the Las Vegas casino scene. Of course, the Kingpin has his own ideas about who the toughest guy in town is, and it’s up to Spider-Man to keep the two of them from destroying Sin City!",

Everyone wants to know who the mysterious Joe Fixit really is, and Spider-Man is on the case (complete with location-appropriate disguises)! Kingpin wants Las Vegas’s toughest enforcer working for him instead of the competition, and he’s prepared to make Joe Fixit an offer he can’t refuse. But Spider-Man is certain that’s still Bruce Banner under that grizzled gray exterior, and he’s not ready to let Bruce go down a path he won’t be able to come back from.",
