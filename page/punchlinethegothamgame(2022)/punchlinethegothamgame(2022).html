Punchline is out of jail and back on the streets of Gotham City. She's not coming back for some of what Gotham has to offer, she's coming back for all of it. She wants to be the queen of crime, and with the help of her Royal Flush Gang no one will stand in her way. But Punchline created a lot of angry enemies in Gotham before she was incarcerated, and they all want payback. Presenting a miniseries that will redefine the criminal landscape of Gotham City from the superstar creative team of Tini Howard (Catwoman, Knights of X), Blake Howard (Batman: Urban Legends), and Gleb Melnikov (Robin, Wonder Woman)!",

PUBLIC ENEMY NUMBER ONE! Punchline crossed a dangerous line at ACE Chemicals, and crossed Batman in the process. Now every masked vigilante and officer of the law is after Punchline, but this is exactly what she wants. What's the point of being a public enemy if you're not going to be public enemy number one? But the scariest person in the Gotham world isn't the Bat...it's the Cat. Catwoman will hunt Punchline and make her pay.",
