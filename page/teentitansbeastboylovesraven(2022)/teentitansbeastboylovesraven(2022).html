"summary":"It seems like years, but it’s only been a few days since Raven Roth recovered her memories; trapped her demon father, Trigon, in her amulet; and had her heart broken for the first time. But she doesn’t have time to worry about the past…she has to focus on finding a way to get rid of Trigon for good. Garfield Logan still can’t believe he has the power to transform into animals. But controlling his newfound abilities is difficult, and their unpredictable nature could have dangerous consequences. Knowing his parents kept this secret hidden from him only makes Gar feel more alone. The heroes are both seeking answers from the one person who seems to have them all figured out: Slade Wilson. When their paths cross in Nashville, Raven and Gar can’t help but feel a connection, despite the secrets they try to hide from each other. It will take a lot of trust and courage to overcome the wounds of their pasts. But can they find acceptance for the darkest parts of themselves? Or maybe even love?",
