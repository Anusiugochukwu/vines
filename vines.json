But who? Mysterious, Joker-like monsters are stalking the streets of Gotham, collecting severed heads. But why? Jim Gordon is missing, and after receiving a package containing a bloody piece of Gotham’s commissioner, Batman knows he must be willing to do anything to save him. But how? When The Joker proposes an uneasy alliance with Batman, the answers to those questions begin to become clear— and they will shake Gotham City and the Bat-Family to their core. This meticulously crafted tale of the Dark Knight’s deadliest team-up will introduce you to a grim and gritty Gotham that only Marc Silvestri could bring you.","date":"20221106","image":"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/RrfOSVnTpnReBvix8r9H-pWWEQv1tfzmEAoonLbqrIUSYBsTVhFi9KZPdiiaZWN28PyH84shgKGrbMlVWtK7CO_N4wCJFdF1d5jc7Xu_J999DLZVg4Fvu8Ji7-t6adUYuBFougZcMA\u003ds1600?rhlupa\u003dMjYwNDphODgwOjQ6MWQwOjo1YTQ6NDAwMA\u0026rnvuka\u003dTW96aWxsYS81LjAgKFgxMTsgTGludXggeDg2XzY0KSBBcHBsZVdlYktpdC81MzcuMzYgKEtIVE1MLCBsaWtlIEdlY2tvKSBIZWFkbGVzc0Nocm9tZS8xMDYuMC41MjQ5LjkxIFNhZmFyaS81MzcuMzY\u003d","name":"Batman \u0026 The Joker - The Deadly Duo (2022) @1","page":"batmanthejokerthedeadlyduo(2022)/batmanthejokerthedeadlyduo(2022)_1.html","category":"Batman \u0026 The Joker - The Deadly Duo (2022)","status":""},{"summary":"THE PILLARS, PART FIVE: STARK REPAIR\n\nANT IN A BOTTLE!
