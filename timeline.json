"info":"Ready. Set. Die! Hundreds are killed every year in an elaborate secret tournament run by a sadistic lunatic with nearly limitless resources at his fingertips. It’s not an urban legend. It’s not a myth. Murderworld is real! It’s online, and the gruesome truth has been hidden from everyone except its victims — until now! This is the wildly violent ride you’ve been waiting for. Gut-wrenching twists, unbelievable deaths and the Avengers bloodier than you’ve ever seen them before as the twisted minds of Jim Zub (CONAN THE BARBARIAN, AVENGERS: NO SURRENDER), Ray Fawkes (WOLVERINES) and a murderers’ row of talented artists deliver the must-have story of the year! Featuring Spider-Man, Moon Knight, Wolverine, Black Widow and the gamesmaster himself, Arcade — who’s putting the murder back into Murderworld!",
