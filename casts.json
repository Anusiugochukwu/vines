Back then, she had contact with the cosmic being Scrier, who had promised her that he would return whenever needed, only to be apparently destroyed. Although Scrier resurrected, Harkness gave him up for dead at the time.\r\n\r\nIn the 17th century, Harkness settled in the English colony of Salem, Massachusetts. She formed her own coven of witches hoping to freely practice magic in the New World. In 1692 A.D., she and her group were persecuted by the Puritans during what became known as the Salem Witch Trials. She encountered the Mutant hero Firestar when she was accidentally sent back in time while fighting the Sphinx. Believing her to be a witch the Puritans tried to burn her at the stake. She fought back but was saved by Agatha leading her to safety. Agatha revealed that she approved of the trials, believing them necessary for the magical people to grow stronger; she even sent some of her coven to cull the weak. She asked Firestar to join her but she refused. Firestar begged Agatha to find another option. Her pleas did not fall on deaf ears and Agatha agreed and settled the town of New Salem, a secret magical community in what would be known Colorado.  She became the most powerful sorceress in this community, and later its grande dame or leader. Agatha was involved in turning over various sorcerers to the witch-killing authorities, on the grounds that she was strengthening the witch community by ridding it of those who could not defend themselves. The fact that New Salemites referred to outsiders as &#34;mortals&#34; may indicate that they had longer lifespans than human beings. The identity of her husband was unknown and it was not even known whether Harkness was her late husband&#39;s last name or her maiden name. Agatha and her husband had only one child together, the warlock known as Nicholas Scratch (which was perhaps his assumed name).  At the end of the 18th century during the American Revolutionary War, Harkness joined the Daughters of Liberty, a group of women fighting for justice in the new world. She used her centuries of knowledge to train them in the mystical arts.\r\n\r\nAt the end of World War II, she was recruited by U.S. Army Major Alan Dakor, alongside The Ghost Dancer and Emerald Warlock, to join the Department of the Uncanny and help stop the threat of Hilda von Hate.\r\n\r\nAgatha Harkness became a governess, tutoring children in need, though she eventually retired. But when the Fantastic Four contacted her to ask her to watch their newborn baby, Franklin Richards, she agreed immediately, once she considered who his parents were.  When the heroes first brought Franklin to her house atop Whisper Hill, she invited them in to spend the night, as it was too late and too stormy for them to return home. Though once The Thing and the Human Torch had settled down, the Thing fell through a swivelling painting in his room, and straight into the clutches of the Frightful Four. The evil four soon captured the rest of the Fantastic Four, but they soon faced Agatha Harkness, whom they underestimated. She warned them that her cat Ebonyâ€™s hackles were up, but the Wizard ignored her warning and attacked. The cat transformed into a massive panther and soon sent him fleeing out of the window, where he smashed into a tree and was knocked unconscious. The Sandman and Trapster attacked moments later, but Agatha turned the Sandmanâ€™s body into rock and used her magic to convince the Trapster that the newly-freed Thing was a monstrous, demonic creature, wherein he fainted dead away in fright.","image":""},
